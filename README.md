# manuel-numerique-scanner
Scanner for a school manual's website

# Usage
./scan.sh [-book <book id>]
Default will scan a whole range of books

# Note
This tool is available as-is and should be considered as a proof of concept rather than used in real life. I condemn any illegal usage of that script.
